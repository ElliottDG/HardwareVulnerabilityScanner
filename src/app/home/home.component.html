        Welcome a hardware vulnerability scanner implemented using the WebHID API. Please note that
         the API is experimental and may not pick up all your USB and Bluetooth devices connected. 
         To use this website, you must be using a Chromium based browser. The button below will be
          greyed out if you are not on a listed compatible browser with the API. As this is
           experimental, more devices will be supported over time so please come back and try this
            regularly ☺️. Mobile not supported.
            <br><br>
        To get started, please click the button below and allow WebHID access to any
         devices shown and the scan will begin, do not refresh the page if this takes longer
          than expected. You will see the screen change when finished.
            <br><br>
            Compatible browsers: Chrome, Edge, Opera
